# vibrating-string
This code simulates a realistic string, which we model as several 100,000 tiny masses connected by springs.
The code allows you to simulate a string of uniform mass density.

# How to run
Clone the directory and navigate to the `Cpp_Implementation` directory.
You can specify the simulation parameters by editing the `params.txt` file.
To run the simulations itself, you first should run the `make command`, then the `make run` command.
